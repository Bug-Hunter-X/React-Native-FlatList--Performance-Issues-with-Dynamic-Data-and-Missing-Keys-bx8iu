In React Native, a subtle bug can occur when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  If the items in your dataset frequently change, and you're not properly managing keys, you might encounter unexpected behavior, such as items flickering, disappearing, or appearing in the wrong order. This is often caused by React Native's diffing algorithm failing to efficiently identify which items have changed.

```javascript
//Buggy component
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <MyComplexItem item={item} />}
/>
```

The issue stems from the `FlatList` relying on keys to track and update items efficiently. Without unique keys, React Native struggles to determine which items have changed, leading to performance issues and visual glitches.
